# UCP Agent Architecture & Integrity Design

This document visualizes the architectural patterns used to guarantee payment integrity and state consistency in the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) Agent.

## 1. Deployment Topology (Multi-Worker)

Illustrates why in-memory locks fail and why we enforce safety at the Persistence Layer.
- **Blue Arrows:** Concurrent race attempts.
- **Green Arrow:** The successful write (Winner).
- **Red Dashed Arrows:** Rejection signals (Losers) due to Version Conflict or Unique Constraint.

## 2. Retry Storm Sequence (Payment Integrity)

Shows how the Database Unique Constraint acts as the "Atomic Guard" against duplicate payments (Double Spend).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Runner as Experiment Runner
    participant Worker as Uvicorn Worker
    participant DB as SQLite DB (Unique Index)

    note over Runner, DB: Scenario: Retry Storm (N=3 Concurrent Requests)

    Runner->>Worker: POST /pay (msgId=101)
    Runner->>Worker: POST /pay (msgId=101)
    Runner->>Worker: POST /pay (msgId=101)

    rect rgb(255, 240, 240)
        note right of Runner: Baseline Mode (Safety Off)
        Worker->>DB: INSERT Order A (No Constraint)
        Worker->>DB: INSERT Order B
        Worker->>DB: INSERT Order C
        DB-->>Worker: Success (3 Orders Created)
        Worker-->>Runner: Return Order A
        Worker-->>Runner: Return Order B
        Worker-->>Runner: Return Order C
    end

    rect rgb(240, 255, 240)
        note right of Runner: Hardened Mode (DB Constraint)
        
        par Parallel Requests
            Worker->>DB: INSERT Order A
        and
            Worker->>DB: INSERT Order A
        and
            Worker->>DB: INSERT Order A
        end

        Note over DB: Constraint Violation Check
        
        DB-->>Worker: Success (Request 1)
        DB--xWorker: ERROR: Unique Constraint (Request 2)
        DB--xWorker: ERROR: Unique Constraint (Request 3)

        par Handling Results
            Worker-->>Runner: Return Order A (Winner)
        and
            Note over Worker: Catch DuplicateOrderError
            Worker->>DB: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE checkout_id=...
            DB-->>Worker: Return Order A
            Worker-->>Runner: Return Order A (Idempotent)
        and
            Note over Worker: Catch DuplicateOrderError
            Worker->>DB: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE checkout_id=...
            DB-->>Worker: Return Order A
            Worker-->>Runner: Return Order A (Idempotent)
        end
    end
```

---

## 3. Mutation Race Sequence (Optimistic Concurrency)

Shows how Versioning (OCC) detects dirty reads when an "Add Item" request interleaves with a "Payment" request.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User (Payment)
    participant Hacker as Attacker (Add Item)
    participant App as Checkout Service
    participant DB as SQLite DB

    note over User, DB: Scenario: Mutation Race (Optimistic Concurrency)

    User->>App: POST /pay (Total: $100)
    App->>DB: READ Cart (Version: 1)
    
    note over App, Hacker: Race Window Starts
    
    Hacker->>App: POST /add-item (Price: $50)
    App->>DB: UPDATE Cart (Total: $150, Version: 2)
    DB-->>App: Success
    
    note over App, Hacker: Cart is now Version 2
    
    App->>DB: CREATE Order (Expect Version: 1)
    
    rect rgb(255, 230, 230)
        note right of App: Validation Logic
        DB->>DB: Check: Current Version (2) != Expected (1)
    end
    
    DB--xApp: Error: StateConflict / Version Mismatch
    App--xUser: 409 Conflict: Cart Modified, Please Retry
    
    note right of DB: Integrity Preserved:<br/>Payment Rejected due to<br/>stale view of cart.
```

---

## 4. Payment Integrity Guard Logic (Flowchart)

The decision tree for handling incoming requests safely.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User Agent Sends 'Complete Checkout']) --> CheckIdem{"Check In-Memory<br/>Idempotency Key?"}
    
    CheckIdem -- "Not Found" --> AttemptCreate["Attempt Atomic Insert<br/>WHERE version = expected"]
    
    AttemptCreate --> CheckResult{"DB Result?"}
    
    CheckResult -- "Success" --> UpdateStatus["Update Checkout Status"]
    UpdateStatus --> StoreResponse["Store in Cache"]
    StoreResponse --> ReturnSuccess([Return Success])
    
    %% The New Path for Mutation Race
    CheckResult -- "Version Mismatch" --> Conflict["Return 409 Conflict<br/>(State Changed)"]
    Conflict --> ReturnError([Client Must Retry])
    
    CheckResult -- "Unique Constraint" --> CatchError["Catch DuplicateOrderError"]
    CatchError --> FetchExisting["Fetch Existing Order"]
    FetchExisting --> ReturnExisting["Return Existing Order"]
    
    ReturnExisting --> ReturnSuccess
    CheckIdem -- "Found" --> ReturnCached["Return Cached"]
    ReturnCached --> ReturnSuccess
```

---

## 5. State Diagram (Order Lifecycle)

Formalizing the idempotent state transition: "Failure to Create" is a valid path to "Success".

```mermaid
stateDiagram
  direction TB
  state FetchExisting {
    direction TB
    [*] --> LookupOrder
    LookupOrder --> ReturnOrder
[*]    LookupOrder
    ReturnOrder
  }
  [*] --> CheckoutPending
  CheckoutPending --> Race:Complete Checkout
  Race --> OrderCreated:Insert Success (Winner)
  Race --> FetchExisting:Insert Failed (Unique Violation)
  FetchExisting --> OrderCreated:Return Existing Order
  OrderCreated --> [*]
  note right of Race 
  Guarded by DB Unique Constraint
        on checkout_id
  end note
```

---

## 6. Conflict Recovery After OCC Rejection

Shows the post-conflict path after a stale write is rejected: the payment attempt arrives with an expected checkout version, the persistence layer detects that storage has advanced, the write fails with a conflict, and the caller must refetch current state before retrying or asking for reconfirmation.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent / Client
    participant API as Checkout Service
    participant DB as Persistence Layer
    participant User as User / Upstream Workflow

    Agent->>API: Complete checkout(checkout_id, expected_version = n)
    API->>DB: create_order_safe(checkout_id, expected_version = n)
    DB->>DB: Re-read checkout version and total

    alt State still matches version n
        DB-->>API: Commit order
        API-->>Agent: Success, return committed order
    else State changed to version n+1
        DB-->>API: 409 StateConflictError
        API-->>Agent: Conflict, latest version = n+1
        Agent->>DB: Refetch latest checkout state

        alt Updated state still acceptable
            Agent->>API: Retry complete checkout(expected_version = n+1)
        else Approval required
            Agent->>User: Ask for reconfirmation
        end
    end

```

---

## 7. Retry-safe checkout completion across concurrent workers.
Stable request identity distinguishes repeated delivery from new intent, a durable idempotency ledger records the winning business action, and the database uniqueness rule on orders(checkout_id) ensures that concurrent writers converge on one committed order.

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client or Agent
    participant W1 as Worker A
    participant W2 as Worker B
    participant L as Idempotency Ledger
    participant DB as orders table UNIQUE(checkout_id)

    C->>W1: complete_checkout(contextid, messageid, checkout_id)
    W1->>L: lookup IdempotencyKey(contextid, messageid, complete_checkout)
    L-->>W1: no committed result found
    W1->>DB: INSERT order for checkout_id=123

    Note over C: acknowledgement is delayed or lost

    C->>W2: retry same complete_checkout(contextid, messageid, checkout_id)
    W2->>L: lookup same idempotency key
    L-->>W2: race window still open
    W2->>DB: INSERT order for checkout_id=123

    DB-->>W1: insert succeeds
    W1->>L: record key -> committed order result

    DB-->>W2: unique constraint violation
    W2->>DB: SELECT order by checkout_id=123
    DB-->>W2: existing committed order
    W2->>L: record or reconcile key -> same committed result

    W1-->>C: completed order
    W2-->>C: same completed order

```

---

## 8. Fast path versus atomic slow path. 
Early idempotency lookup and in-memory locking can intercept likely duplicates, but only the database unique constraint on orders(checkout_id) settles the race across workers. The winning request commits the order, and the losing request re-reads that canonical row and returns the same business result. 

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    A[Request arrives: complete_checkout] --> B[Fast path: idempotency lookup]
    B -->|Hit| C[Return recorded result]
    B -->|Miss| D[Local coordination: InMemoryLockManager]

    D --> E[Slow path: attempt order insert]
    E --> F[DB boundary: UNIQUE orders checkout_id]

    F -->|Winner| G[Insert succeeds]
    G --> H[Store replay record]
    H --> I[Return completed checkout]

    F -->|Loser| J[DuplicateOrderError]
    J --> K[get_order_by_checkout_id checkout_id]
    K --> L[Return same committed order]

```

---

## 9. The schema settles the race. 
Advisory replay checks may detect likely duplicates early, but the unique index on orders(checkout_id) is the shared enforcement point that allows one committed order row and forces the loser to reconcile by re-reading the canonical order.

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    A[Worker A receives complete_checkout] --> B[Carry request identity]
    C[Worker B receives retry for same checkout] --> D[Carry same request identity]

    B --> E[Advisory replay lookup]
    D --> F[Advisory replay lookup]

    E --> G[Store attempts INSERT into orders]
    F --> H[Store attempts INSERT into orders]

    G --> I[(UNIQUE index: orders.checkout_id)]
    H --> I

    I -->|winner| J[One order row commits]
    I -->|loser| K[sqlite3.IntegrityError]

    K --> L[Store raises DuplicateOrderError]
    L --> M[Service calls get_order_by_checkout_id]

    J --> N[Canonical order exists]
    M --> N

    N --> O[Repeated delivery converges on one durable result]

```

---

## 10. Commit authority stays below the model boundary. 
The model may select complete_checkout, and local replay checks may reduce duplicate work, but only the database commit boundary can decide whether a new order is created or a duplicate must reconcile to the canonical row.

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    A[User intent] --> B[LLM selects action: complete_checkout]
    B --> C[Service binds durable request identity]
    C --> D[Replay lookup via idempotency layer<br/>advisory]
    C --> E[InMemoryLockManager<br/>local advisory only]
    D --> F[Store issues order insert]
    E --> F
    F --> G{Database commit boundary<br/>UNIQUE checkout_id}
    G -->|Commit succeeds| H[New order committed]
    G -->|Duplicate rejected| I[DuplicateOrderError]
    I --> J[Service re-reads get_order_by_checkout_id]
    H --> K[Return canonical durable result]
    J --> K
    K --> L[LLM may explain result after commit]

```

---

## 11. Checkout version lifecycle. 
A payment attempt begins from one persisted checkout version. If another actor mutates the checkout before commit, the version advances and the original payment attempt becomes stale. The order path must compare the caller's last-seen version with storage before creating the order.

```mermaid

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Incomplete_v1: create_checkout()

    Incomplete_v1 --> Incomplete_v2: add_to_checkout(), save_checkout()
    Incomplete_v2 --> Ready_v3: start_payment(), save_checkout()

    Ready_v3 --> Mutated_v4: concurrent cart change, save_checkout(), version = 4
    Ready_v3 --> CommitCheck: complete_checkout(), expected_version = 3

    CommitCheck --> Completed_v4: stored version = 3, order created, save_checkout()
    CommitCheck --> Conflict: stored version != 3, raise StateConflictError

    note right of Ready_v3
      Payment starts from a specific
      persisted checkout version.
    end note

    note right of Mutated_v4
      Another actor changes the checkout
      before payment commits.
    end note

    note right of Conflict
      The original write is stale and must
      refresh state before any next step.
    end note

```

##12. Persistence-boundary validation in the repository

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as CheckoutService
    participant Store as SQLiteStore
    participant DB as SQLite DB

    S->>Store: create_order_safe(checkout, expected_version)
    Store->>DB: SELECT version, total_cents FROM checkouts WHERE checkout_id=?
    DB-->>Store: real_version, real_total

    alt real_version != expected_version or real_total != checkout.total_cents
        Store-->>S: raise StateConflictError
        Note over S,DB: No order insert. Stale write rejected.
    else state matches
        Note over Store,DB: Validation connection closes here
        Store->>DB: INSERT INTO orders (order_id, checkout_id, total_cents, permalink_url)
        DB-->>Store: commit
        Store-->>S: return Order
    end

    Note over Store,DB: Gap between validation and insert is the current commit boundary
```
